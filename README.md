# A clone of a classic.

We have rocks, we have lasers and we have a triangle.

## Controls
* rotate left  : left arrow / A
* rotate right : right arrow / D
* thrust       : up arrow / W
* fire lasers  : ctrl / space*

*space bar may not always work with some key combos. Don't blame me it's the keyboard manufacturers skimping out.
