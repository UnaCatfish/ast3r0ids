# A clone of a classic.

We have rocks, we have lasers and we have a triangle.

## Controls
rotate left  : left arrow / A
rotate right : right arrow / D
thrust       : up arrow / W
fire lasers  : ctrl / space*

*space bar may not always work with some key combos. Don;t blame me it's the keyboard manufacturers skimping out. Just use the ctrl key instead.
